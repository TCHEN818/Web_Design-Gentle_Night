# Web_Design-Gentle_Night
The concepts of space and universe are even widely used in many fields. For example, in the field of marketing, KFC did a marketing campaign last year. They joined hands with private space company World View to send their new fried chicken sandwiches to a height of 30 miles (about 48 kilometers) from the ground. The entire space journey will last for four days. In the air, the sandwich will take a few selfies on the camera. Human exploration of space and universe will make the future full of possibilities. The website we build is designed for the company, so we boldly assume that we are a private technology company called Gentle Night that provides space customization service. Our webpage is a long scrolling webpage. The content of this webpage is to display products and customer experience, introduce the team as well as contact form.
